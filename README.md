# Assassin Thuls

A content pack for [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/) that redo Thuls' traits.

But because of my ability, there are some little bugs about **Nightstalker**, **Venomous Shade** and **Shadow Execution**. They shouldn't cause game broken, just need to reload combat after you load the old save.

I will try to fix all bugs.

I'll be modifying this data frequently to make balance. So the picture maybe isn't the true number. You can check them out at the Tome of Knowledge in game.
